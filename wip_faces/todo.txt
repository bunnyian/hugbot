baseline features to implement:
X [10min] get hello world printed on lcd
X [10min] get the one-row heart eyes printed on lcd
X [10min] get the two-row 😍 face printed on lcd (for when user is happy)
X [10min] compress the 12 byte heart to 8 bytes.
X [5min] add a little mouth 
X [10min] get the one-row •w• face printed on lcd (for when user is neutral)
X [10min] get the one-row 4 byte 🥺 face printed on lcd (for when user is sad/angry)
X [2min] replace 😍 face with one-row ^w^ due to RAM limitations (for when user is happy)
X [5min] create a blink animation that goes off every now and then and overrides the current face's eyes 
X [15min] integrate with robotcontrol.ino

extra features I'd like implement to make it cooler:
X [5min] display eyes with a given horizontal offset 
- [15min] output normalized horizontal position of largest bounding box from facial detection code to serial port
- [15min] adjust the horizontal offset of eyes accordingly to implement eye tracking 😎
